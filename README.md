# Group-Project-2016-Team-Magia
We are making  a game called Ix Chels Quest

For a new feature:
 - create new branch (preferably with feature as the name)
 - work on this branch do commits etc. on the new branch
 - check back to master branch 
 - merge new branch into master branch

Code for this:\n
 -?>git branch [new_branch]\n
 -?>git checkout [new_branch]\n
 -//start working\n
 -//end working\n
 -?>git add [everything_new]\n
 -?>git commit\n
 -?>git checkout master\n
 -?>git merge [new_branch]\n
 -//if this does not work initially, contact me\n
