# Group-Project-2016-Team-Magia
We are making  a game called Ix Chels Quest

For a new feature:
 - create new branch (preferably with feature as the name)
 - work on this branch do commits etc. on the new branch
 - check back to master branch 
 - merge new branch into master branch

Code for this:
 ?>git branch [new_branch]
 ?>git checkout [new_branch]
 //start working
 //end working
 ?>git add [everything_new]
 ?>git commit
 ?>git checkout master
 ?>git merge [new_branch]
 //if this does not work initially, contact me
