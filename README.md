We are making  a game called Ix Chels Quest

For a new feature:
 - create new branch (preferably with feature as the name)
 - work on this branch do commits etc. on the new branch
 - check back to master branch 
 - merge new branch into master branch

Code for this (Open the GitShell to use these commands):
 <br>?>git branch [new_branch]
 <br>?>git checkout [new_branch]
 <br>//start working
 <br>//end working
 <br>?>git add [everything_new]
 <br>?>git commit
 <br>?>git checkout master
 <br>?>git merge [new_branch] //if this does not work initially, contact me
 <br>//if your local repository is behind the server's repository: ?>git rebase origin/master
 <br>?>git push
